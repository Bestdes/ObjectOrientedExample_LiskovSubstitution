    Learned: Liskov Substitution Principle
    The Liskov Substitution principle states that subtypes must be substitutable for their
    base-types. For example: if S is a sub-type of T, then object of type T in a program
    may be replaced with objects of type S.

    This principle is key in making the program and design more dynamic and adaptable.
